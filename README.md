### Project Title
Bikeshare_2.py

### Description
This project uses data, provided by Motivae, to investigate bike share usage patterns for three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

We will investigate station statistics, time and date statistics, and user statistics.
### Files used
Software used included Python and Visual Studio Code.

Files used in this project include bikeshare_2.py, chicago.csv, washington.csv, and new_york_city.csv

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have gender and birth year
