The Bikeshare Project was created 7/18/21 and this Read Me file was created on 8/16/21.

### Project Title
Bikeshare_2

### Description
This project was created to investigate the Bikeshare usage patterns across three three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

The project is interactive and allows users to select which city and which data they would like to view.

Available data includes the most common month, the  most common day of week, and the most common start hour traveled. Additionally data can be reviewed for the most common start and end station along with the most popular start and end station combination. Total and mean travel time can be displayed as well as a variety of user stats, including gender count and birthyear.

### Files used
Files used include randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also contain gender and birth year.

The file names are chicago.csv, new_york-city.csv, and washington.csv
